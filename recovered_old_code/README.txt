Recovered files were exported here from git commit 964868b, but their .cs copies were removed from the project to avoid duplicate symbols.

You can restore any file from git using commands such as:

  git show 964868b:LuaRunner.cs > LuaRunner_restored.cs

Or reopen the files directly from the commit in your Git GUI.
